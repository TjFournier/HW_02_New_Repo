I pulled from two different data files to be able to compare the growth of GDP for the US and China. The data can be found [here for the US](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json) and [here for China.](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/CHN/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json)
